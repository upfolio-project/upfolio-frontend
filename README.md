**UpFolio** is a **digital portfolio** & **CV** sharing platform for beginner specialists with handy features for describing your skills.

## Architecture

We've introduced one extra layer named _layouts_. This layer is placed between the _pages_ and _widgets_ layers.  

## UI kit

Our UI kit isn't released to open-source and is based on  [MUI](https://mui.com/)
